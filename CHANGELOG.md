## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-31

First public release.

### Added

- **Planner as a conversation.** One continuous chat that researches the repo
  read-only, asks when a goal is vague, and whose final message *is* the plan
  ([ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-planner-as-conversation-loop.md)).
- **Per-task model routing.** Every task carries its own runner, model, thinking
  effort and mode, chosen by the planner across the whole plan and editable
  before anything runs.
- **Harness planners.** Claude Code, Codex or OpenCode can act as the planner on
  a subscription you already hold, with no separate API key
  ([ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-coding-agents-as-planners.md)).
- **Evidence-based verdicts.** A task completes only when its unique completion
  marker appears in the runner's output; exit code is kept as diagnostic
  evidence and the model is never the tie-breaker.
- **Three surfaces over one core** — a VS Code extension, a full-screen terminal
  UI ([ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-tui-pure-core-thin-driver.md)), and a CLI where
  every slash command is also a subcommand.
- **Read-only exploration envelope.** Reads run in parallel, anything reaching
  outside the workspace asks once, and commands that would write are refused
  ([ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-planner-exploration-envelope.md)).
- **Runner plugins.** Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode are built in; any other
  CLI agent is a manifest, not a code change.
- **Windows support** across every surface except the tmux-backed TUI
  ([ADR-0010](docs/adr/0010-windows-support.md)).
- Deep-interview planning modes: `grill-me`, PRD drafting, TDD augmentation,
  review and verify.
